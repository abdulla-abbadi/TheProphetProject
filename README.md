# TheProphetProject

This is a project built with Django Rest API and React.js.
In this project, I created an API that sends Haiths (The recorded saying of the prophet Mohammed peace be upon him) as JSON data, which then react consumes these data to be presented in the front-end UI.

To run and test the project you need docker and docker-compose.
In the main directory run
$ docker-compose up --build -d
to access the front end go to http://localhost:3000
to access the back-end API go to http://localhost:8000/api

To see the end user UI which is hosted in AWS go to this website: https://hadithsoftheprophet.com/, you will notice that the project is still in development where I'm working on the content right now.
