# TheProphetProject
This is a project built with Django Rest API and React.js. 
In this project I created an api that sends Haiths (The recored saying of the prophet Mohammed peace be upon him) which react consumes these data to be presented in the front end UI.

To run and test the project you need docker and docker compose.
Mn the them main directory run 
$ docker-compose up --build -d 
to access the front end go to http://localhost:3000
to access the back end api go to http://localhost:8000/api
